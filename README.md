## Everything you need to know!

* This website has three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.

*  On the Google Search page, there are links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search and Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there is a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.

* On the Google Search page, the user can type in a query, click “Google Search”, and will be taken to the Google search results for that page.

* On the Google Image Search page, the user can type in a query, click a search button, and will be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

* On the Google Advanced Search page, the user can provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
  * Find pages  with… “all these words:”
  * Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
  * Find pages with… “any of these words:”
  * Find pages with… “none of these words:”

* There is an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button in the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link will take the user directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
